      <div class="fontThis">
        <p>Throughout my high school years, I consistently earned merit awards from Grade 7 to Grade 12, with the sole exception of Grade 9. That year was particularly challenging as I was still adjusting to the sudden shift brought about by the pandemic, and my performance in ESP (Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao) slightly lowered my overall average, breaking my line of 90. Despite that setback, my academic journey remained marked by dedication and resilience.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I often took on leadership roles, guiding my peers in various activities and projects. These experiences taught me how to manage diverse groups of people, encourage collaboration, and create an environment where individuals could freely apply and develop their skills. Leading others not only strengthened my ability to organise and communicate effectively but also helped me grow into someone who values both teamwork and personal initiative.</p>

      <h1>More about me!</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello Hallo! I’m Chaz Vincent Aurin, a Bachelor of Computer Science student from CIIT. 
        I’ve been a fan of the digital space since my early introduction to anime during childhood, and I’m passionate about how my childhood dreams can blossom into ideas that help the world in my own way. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">At CIIT, I’ve been learning how to integrate my ideas into practical applications, grounding my idealistic desire to help others in a more realistic approach. 
        I find satisfaction in mastering the fundamentals required for my coding projects, while still having the freedom to incorporate my own creativity and innovation into them.</p>
